[*SparkX  ESP32 LoRa Single-Channel Gateway (SPX-14893)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14893)

The SparkX ESP32 LoRa Single-Channel Gateway combines an ESP32 -- a programmable microcontroller featuring both WiFi and Bluetooth radios -- with an RFM95W LoRa transceiver to create a single-channel LoRa gateway. It's a perfect, low-cost tool for monitoring a dozen-or-so LoRa devices, and relaying their messages up to the cloud.

Complete with a [Qwiic connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and a breadboard-compatible array of ESP32 pin-breakouts, this board can can also serve as a general-purpose ESP32/RFM95W development platform. So, instead of using it as a LoRaWAN gateway, you can turn it into a **LoRa device**, and use the powerful ESP32 microcontroller to monitor sensors, host a web server, run a display or more.

These boards are a great way to begin dipping your toes into the world of LoRa and LoRaWAN. Not only can they be programmed as versatile single-channel gateway, but they can also be used as a LoRa device, or a general ESP32/RFM95W development board.
